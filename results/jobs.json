Our CEO and founder is an engineer who still codes non\\-stop, and our Group Product Lead is a product designer by trade who still spends half his time in design. Here, your work has a direct impact on the safety of millions of people, and you will never have to explain the \"value of design\" to leadership: they already live it.\n\n **Job Requirements*** **Mobile Redesign:** Take ownership direction of the end\\-to\\-end mobile app experience with the support of senior product leads. You will transform complex fire safety inspection workflows into intuitive, high\\-performance interfaces on iOS and Android.\n* **Conduct Field Research:** Use a generous travel budget to get out of the office and onto job sites in Australia, the UK, and the US. You will see exactly how technicians use your work in real\\-world environments.\n* **Prototype with Purpose:** Move fast with interactive prototypes, whether you build them manually or leverage AI. We value designers who communicate through motion and flow rather than just static screens.\n* **Partner with Engineering:** Work side\\-by\\-side with a world\\-class engineering team. We have two deployments every single day, meaning you could design a solution in the morning and see it shipped to users by the afternoon.\n* **Bridge Strategy and Craft:** Collaborate with product leads to ensure your designs solve core operational problems and drive business strategy, not just aesthetics.\n\n **How to Apply**  \n\nWe don\u2019t need a perfectly polished portfolio: we care about real work and your ability to ship. Please include a link to your portfolio or things you have actually delivered and are in the hands of users. Be ready to present one feature you are particularly proud of, or even one where you learned a hard lesson.  \n\n  \n\nThe Process\n\n* **The Intro Call:** A short chat with our Group PM to talk about your background and where you want to go.\n* **Product Demo:** You will walk us through one example of delivered work. This is a discussion about your experience and process, not an interrogation.\n* **Design Challenge:** A practical exercise to see how you tackle real\\-world problems.\n* **Culture and Vision:** A final catch\\-up with the team and our CEO to ensure we are a great fit for each other.\n* **The Offer:** If it is a match, we move fast.\n\n **Job Responsibilities*** **The Builder Mindset:** You have at least 5\\+ years of experience in a SaaS environment and a portfolio of mobile features you have actually shipped.\n* **Mobile Native:** You are deeply familiar with the nuances of iOS and Android design and know how to build for users who are on the move.\n* **Melbourne Based:** You live in Melbourne and thrive in a hybrid culture where we get together in person to solve the hard stuff.\n* **Deep Curiosity:** You are obsessed with the \"why\" and are driven by real\\-world outcomes rather than just design outputs.\n* **High Autonomy:** You have a bias for action. You would rather make it happen and iterate than wait for a permission slip.\n\n **Job Benefits*** **World\\-Class Mentorship:** You will collaborate with four of the best designers in Australia in an environment where design is a core pillar of the company.\n* **Global Travel:** A dedicated budget to visit our international markets and understand the challenges of technicians on the ground in the UK and US.\n* **Unicorn Trajectory:** Join a company growing at 40% year\\-on\\-year on the path to becoming Australia\u2019s next tech giant.\n* **Full Transparency:** Clear salary expectations and total visibility into the company\u2019s goals and trajectory.",
