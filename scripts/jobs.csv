 **About APRA**


Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was established in 1998 as an independent statutory authority that supervises almost 1,200 financial institutions that manage $8\\.6 trillion in assets for Australians across the banking, insurance and superannuation sectors.

  

In overseeing the safety, competitiveness and stability of the financial system, we seek to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled professionals, who want to help shape financial services and protect the financial wellbeing of the Australian community. Our employee base of almost 900 come predominantly from the commercial financial services industry or other government agencies; as such, we have the feel of a small corporate organisation that can work flexibly and with agility.

  

At APRA, we’re committed to providing an inclusive workplace where everyone belongs, feels valued and respected. We aspire to attract and foster diversity of background, thought, and experience, recognising that a broad range of perspectives, approaches and ideas makes us stronger, and better enables us to meet our obligation to protect the financial wellbeing of the Australian community. If you need any adjustments during the recruitment process, please inform at application stage so we can do our best to accommodate your requirements.","","https://au.indeed.com/cmp/Australian-Prudential-Regulation-Authority-(apra)","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/74612152d1fe9f46470da96abed065b7","https://www.apra.gov.au/","","","","","","","","","",""
